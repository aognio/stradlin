Your name can't be numeric! Are you a clone trooper or what?\"\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n  } else {\r\n    $doc = array(\r\n      \"status\" => \"ok\",\r\n      \"data\" => array(\r\n        \"greeting\" => \"Hello Mr. or Mrs. $name!!! Welcome to Stradlin :)\"\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n  serve_json($doc, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to have the clean URLs working please use the provided .htaccess file for Apache and write/include your controllers from index.php or simple adapt it to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of controllers, this microframework should have been called 'Axl', that's a real control freak! :)\r\n\r\nFor more information please read the freaking sources and please stay tuned.\r\n\r\n(c) 2012 - Bit Zeppelin S.A.C. - Developed by Antonio Ognio a.k.a @gnrfan\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
